# Tastes like chicken

What tastes like chicken? Rotten flesh is what!

## Features

Tastes like chicken is a Minecraft Datapack that lets you cook _rotten flesh_ to produce _cooked chicken_.

The noxious flesh can be cooked on the campfire, furnace, and smoker, with the usual effect on cooking time. Cooking one flesh stores 0.1 xp in the furnace/smoker.
